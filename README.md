  ### Hello, hello
  I'm a 17yo french student, who loves electronic stuff, but also music, anime and drawing (that's what you call a 'weeb').  
  At school I'm learning maths and biology, and I'm planning to learn computer science more in-depth next year.
  
  I'm currently working on:
  - [ArtichOS](https://github.com/ArtichOwO/ArtichOS), a little 16 bit OS which does pretty much nothing, except it allows me to improve myself in low-level programming;
  - [ArtiLang](https://github.com/ArtichOwO/ArtiLang) (yes it's a lot of "arti"-thing but it's temporary names) a simple programming language meant to create 16-bits 8086 applications, with a syntax similar to C;
  - [4channer](https://github.com/ArtichOwO/4channer), an iOS read-only 4chan client.
  
  My main programming languages are Python, OCaml and a bit of C/C++ with (N)ASM (ew AT&T). I'm bad in all these languages but I'm still improving :3
