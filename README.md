### Hello, hello ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
I'm a french student, who loves electronic stuff, but also music, anime and drawing.  
At school I'm learning maths and biology, and I'm planning to learn computer science more in-depth next year.  

<hr />

I'm currently working on:
- [ArtichOS](https://github.com/ArtichOwO/ArtichOS), a little 16 bit OS which does pretty much nothing, except it allows me to improve myself in low-level programming;
- [r86](https://github.com/ArtichOwO/r86), a simple programming language meant to create 16-bits 8086 applications, with a syntax similar to C;
- [Indigobi](https://github.com/Tim-ats-d/Indigobi), a cute terminal-based Gemini client, with a friend.

My main programming languages are OCaml, JS and a bit of C with (N)ASM (ew AT&T). I'm bad in all these languages but I'm still improving :3
