  ### Hello, hello
  I'm a 17yo french student, who loves electronic stuff, but also music, anime and drawing (that's what you call a 'weeb').  
  At school I'm learning maths and biology, and I'm planning to learn computer science more in-depth next year.
  
  I'm currently working on:
  - [ArtichOS](https://github.com/ArtichOwO/ArtichOS), a little 16 bit OS which does pretty much nothing, except it allows me to improve myself in low-level programming;
  - small contributions to [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega) (now [Upsilon](https://github.com/Lauryy06/Upsilon)), an alternative OS for the [NumWorks calculator](https://www.numworks.com);
  - porting apps to the [Upsilon external apps installer website](https://github.com/Lauryy06/Upsilon-External);
  - my personal website, but there's no code here since I didn't even finished the design part lmao.
  
  My main programming languages are Python, JavaScript (Node - Vue.JS) and a bit of C/C++ with ASM. I'm bad in all these languages but I'm still improving :3
